Welcome to my blog. It will detail my progress on my University VR-Project. 
The goal of the class is to implement a locomotion and interaction technique for a given VR-Parkour.

As you can see, the player starts in the bottom left corner of the map. He then has to traverse a slalom section followed by
3 long segments with a bridge in the middle. Each section features a bunch of coins the player can collect and an interaction
task.

My next post will detail how I came up with my locomotion technique and what motivates it.
